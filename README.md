### Introduction

The Hibernate Types repository gives you extra types and general purpose utilities that are not supported by the Hibernate ORM core. 

The main advantage of this project is that it supports a broad range of Hibernate versions, spanning from Hibernate 4.1 to Hibernate 5.4.

### Features

#### JSON 

##### Oracle

You should use the `JsonStringType` to map a `VARCHAR2` column type storing JSON.

You should use the `JsonBlobType` to map a `BLOB` column type storing JSON.

For more details, check out [this article](https://vladmihalcea.com/oracle-json-jpa-hibernate/).

##### SQL Server

You should use this `JsonStringType` to map an `NVARCHAR` column type storing JSON.

##### PostgreSQL

You should use this `JsonBinaryType` to map both `jsonb` and `json` column types.

For more details, check out [this article](https://vladmihalcea.com/how-to-map-json-objects-using-generic-hibernate-types/).

##### MySQL

You should use this `JsonStringType` to map the `json` column type.

### Are you struggling with application performance issues?

<img src="https://vladmihalcea.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Hypersistence-Optimizer-300x250.jpg" alt="Hypersistence Optimizer">
</a>

Imagine having a tool that can automatically detect if you are using JPA and Hibernate properly. No more performance issues, no more having to spend countless hours trying to figure out why your application is barely crawling.

Imagine discovering early during the development cycle that you are using suboptimal mappings and entity relationships or that you are missing performance-related settings. 

More, with Hypersistence Optimizer, you can detect all such issues during testing and make sure you don't deploy to production a change that will affect data access layer performance.

[Hypersistence Optimizer](https://vladmihalcea.com/hypersistence-optimizer/?utm_source=GitHub&utm_medium=banner&utm_campaign=hibernatetypes) is the tool you've been long waiting for!

#### Training

If you are interested in on-site training, I can offer you my [High-Performance Java Persistence training](https://vladmihalcea.com/trainings/?utm_source=GitHub&utm_medium=banner&utm_campaign=hibernatetypes)
which can be adapted to one, two or three days of sessions. For more details, check out [my website](https://vladmihalcea.com/trainings/?utm_source=GitHub&utm_medium=banner&utm_campaign=hibernatetypes).

#### Consulting

### How to remove the Hypersistence Optimizer banner from the log?

#### Why the Hypersistence Optimizer banner?

Maintaining this project costs me money. Therefore, I basically have two options when it comes to maintaining it.

1. I could just abandon it since it does not really bring me any revenue and focus all my time on my [blog](https://vladmihalcea.com/), [training](https://vladmihalcea.com/trainings/), [courses](https://courses.vladmihalcea.com/), [books](https://vladmihalcea.com/books/high-performance-java-persistence/), [consulting](https://vladmihalcea.com/consulting/) or developing [Hypersistence Optimizer](https://vladmihalcea.com/hypersistence-optimizer/).
2. Or, I could keep on maintaining it at my own expense for the price of displaying a log-based banner during bootstrap.

I believe the latter option is much better for the hundreds of thousands of users benefiting from this project.

#### Adding Hypersistence Optimizer to your project

Using Hibernate without [Hypersistence Optimizer](https://vladmihalcea.com/hypersistence-optimizer/) is highly discouraged, hence the reason for that banner. You can view it as a `WARN` log message that tells you are risking application performance issues if you don't make sure you use the right JPA mappings and Hibernate configuration properties.

> If you want to see why it's a bad idea to use JPA and Hibernate without a tool that inspects your mappings and configurations, check out this [video presentation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1nOVct9P2g).

So, the easiest way to have the banner removed is to add [Hypersistence Optimizer](https://vladmihalcea.com/hypersistence-optimizer/) to your project.

### Setting the `hibernate.types.print.banner=false` configuration setting

You can disable the banner by providing the `hibernate.types.print.banner=false` in either `hibernate.properties` or `hibernate-types.properties` file.

> For Spring and Spring Boot, this [Pull Request](https://github.com/hibernate/hibernate-orm/pull/2649) is needed to be integrated into Hibernate ORM. 
>
> Once this Pull Request is integrated, you could pass the `hibernate.types.print.banner=false` configuration property from the `application.properties` file. 
>
> So, in the meanwhile, you could vote for the [HHH-13103 issue](https://hibernate.atlassian.net/browse/HHH-13103) and remind the Hibernate team that you really need that Pull Request to be integrated. Hopefully, it will be added to the project sooner than later.
